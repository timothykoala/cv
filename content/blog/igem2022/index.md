As the co-founder of the iGEM team of my alma mater, starting up the first team from sketch is the most unforgettable experience in my undergraduate. The experience about how I built the iGEM team before and those comments I got from the previous iGEM judges and seniors I met always encouraged me to overcome the hardship of my career till now. Even though I had moved to the next stage of my career and relocated far away from my previous university, I hope to continue staying connected with the iGEM community and contribute my ability in a different aspect. As a iGEM judge who can directly interact with talented, curious young minds in synthetic biology around the world.

It is happy to meet up in person for the iGEM Jamboree, especially after 2 years remotely, not in Boston but Paris this year.

<!-- Tip: open with the why, then show results, code, and next steps. -->
