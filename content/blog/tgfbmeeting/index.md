It's a fruitful summer at Malahide, Ireland. While listened to many interesting talks from TGF-β field, a flash talk and poster titled as the involvement of MLL4 histone methyltransferase and AP-1 in TGF-β signaling transcriptional activation was presented.

Additionally, I am happy to be selected as winners of the TGF-ß Superfamily Conference Travel Award from the organizer.
